    <h3>Using Selective Media</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Double click first text field to select a folder containing media files that will be played between the time
            shown on the first time field and the time shown on the second time field.
        </li>

        <li>
            Double click second text field to select a folder containing media files that will be played between the
            time shown on the second time field and the time shown on the first time field, initially.
            <br>
            The reverse will be the case (unless sequential is selected in #8) every other time media file is selected
            for playback, when it is selected from #3.
            <br>
            The very first media file played may be from the folder from #4.
        </li>

        <li>
            Double click third text field to select a folder containing media files that will be played (every other
            time) between the time shown on the second time field and the time shown on the first time field.
        </li>

        <li>
            Doublic click fourth field to select a file that contains applications you want to run, instead of playing a
            media file.
            <br>
            It is recommended to use a text file (.txt) for this purpose.
            <br>
            You can cun multiple applications - put the full path to each application (e.g.
            C:\Windows\System32\Notepad.exe) in its own line, all
            of them will be run.
        </li>

        <li>
            Double click fifth text field to select a folder containing picture files that will be set (randomly) as
            desktop background (initially) between the time shown on the second time field and the time shown on the
            first time field.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whatever you type inside the sixth text field is going to be said (by the computer) initially if you set
            mode to one that is Sequential (#8).
        </li>

        <li>
            Select how fast you want media files to be played in succession - Ad is faster than Relaxed.
            <br>
            If you choose any sequentially mode however, this rate is ignored, media files are played one after the
            other with little or no time interval.
        </li>

        <li>
            Select how you want media files to be played in succession - randomly or sequentially.
        </li>
    </ol>
